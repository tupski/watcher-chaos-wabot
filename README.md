## ÔøΩ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Commands Not Working (!tagall, !hell)
1. **Check if the bot is properly authenticated with WhatsApp**
   - Make sure you've scanned the QR code successfully
   - Check the console for "WhatsApp client is ready!" message

2. **Verify environment variables**
   - Ensure `.env` file exists and contains all required variables
   - Check that `DISCORD_TOKEN` is set correctly (see DISCORD_SETUP.md)

3. **Discord Bot Issues**
   - Enable MESSAGE CONTENT intent in Discord Developer Portal
   - Verify the bot has proper permissions in your Discord server
   - Check that `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID` matches your target channel

#### Tagall Command Issues
1. **"This command can only be used in group chats" Error**
   - Ensure you're using the command in a WhatsApp group, not private chat
   - Check console logs for group detection details
   - Bot will show group info in logs for debugging

2. **No Mentions Working**
   - Ensure bot has been added to the group properly
   - Check if group participants are loaded correctly
   - Bot needs to fetch participants which may take a moment

#### Anti Spam Link Not Working
1. **Check ALLOWED_LINKS configuration**
   - Ensure `ALLOWED_LINKS` is set in your `.env` file
   - Use comma-separated values for multiple allowed domains
   - Example: `ALLOWED_LINKS=https://example.com,https://trusted-site.com`

2. **Bot Permissions and Configuration**
   - Bot must be admin in WhatsApp group to delete messages
   - If bot can't delete messages, it will send warning instead
   - Supported link formats: `https://`, `http://`, `www.`, and `domain.com`
   - Configure `ALLOWED_LINKS` with domain names only (no http/https needed)
   - Example: `ALLOWED_LINKS=example.com,google.com,github.com`

#### Hell Event Filter Configuration
1. **ONLY_WATCHER_CHAOS Setting**
   - Set `ONLY_WATCHER_CHAOS=true` to only receive Watcher/Chaos Dragon notifications
   - Set `ONLY_WATCHER_CHAOS=false` to receive all Hell Event notifications
   - The `!hell` command always shows the latest event regardless of filter setting

#### Hell Command Shows "Data tidak tersedia"
1. **Discord Integration Issues**
   - Verify Discord bot token is correct
   - Check if the bot is in the correct Discord server
   - Ensure MESSAGE CONTENT intent is enabled
   - Verify `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID` is correct

2. **No Hell Event Data**
   - The bot needs to receive at least one Hell Event message from Discord first
   - Check Discord channel for Hell Event messages in the correct format

#### Installation Issues
1. **Node.js Not Found**
   - Install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
   - Verify installation with `node --version` and `npm --version`

2. **Dependencies Issues**
   - Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
   - If issues persist, try `npm ci` for clean install
